# NSynth-MIDI-Renderer

This Project is intended to provide a simple way to synthesize any MIDI sequence to an audio file using the notes of the NSynth dataset. It works by substituting each note in the sequence with the specified instrument, pitch and velocity for all the notes in the sequence.

# Quick start
Clone this repository to your system.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hmartelb/NSynth-MIDI-Renderer.git
```

To start synthesizing audios, you need to download the NSynth dataset and some MIDI files. Here are two useful links:

* The NSynth Dataset, “A large-scale and high-quality dataset of annotated musical notes.” https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth

* Classical Music MIDI Dataset, Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi

Also, make sure that you have **Python 3.6** installed in your system. Then open a new terminal in the master directory and install the dependencies from requirements.txt by executing this command:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to use it 
For the general use case, 3 parameters must be specified:
1)	The path to the NSynth Dataset (audios directory)
2)	The MIDI file (*.mid, *.midi) containing the sequence
3)	The output path and name for the audio (*.wav)

## Run from the main

To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
$ python NoteSynthesizer.py --db <path_to_nsynth> --seq <midi_filename> --output <audio_filename>
```
Additionally, there are some optional parameters:

# Import the NoteSynthesizer Class into a Python script
It is also possible to use the NoteSynthesizer Class in a Python script to have custom functionality. Here is a generic way to import and use it:

```python
from NoteSynthesizer import NoteSynthesizer

# Initialize variables here
# ...

# Create the NoteSynthesizer instance
synth = NoteSynthesizer(path_to_nsynth, sr, velocities, preload)  

# Generate the audio for a given MIDI sequence
y, _ = synth.render_sequence(sequence, instrument, source_type, preset, transpose, playback_speed, duration_scale)

# Save or process the audio (y)
# ...

```

# Examples
The files in the /output folder have been generated using different instruments, with sr=44100, playback_speed=1 and duration_scale=4, leaving the rest of optional parameters as default. The files are named using the following convention:
```bash
<midi_name>_<instrument>_<source_type>_<preset>.wav
```
